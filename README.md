# Titanic Survival Prediction: A Comparative Analysis

**Predicting the Fate of Titanic Passengers**

This repository explores the tragic tale of the RMS Titanic through the lens of data science. By leveraging machine learning techniques, we delve into the factors that influenced passenger survival, aiming to predict their fate based on available information.

## Data Exploration and Preprocessing

* **Data Cleaning:** Handling missing values, outliers, and inconsistencies.
* **Feature Engineering:** Creating new features from existing ones, such as family size and title.
* **Data Splitting:** Dividing the dataset into training and testing sets.

## Model Implementation and Evaluation

We implemented and evaluated several machine learning models:

| Model | Accuracy |
|---|---|
| Decision Tree Classifier | 0.7988835 |
| Random Forest Classifier | 0.7877090 |
| Logistic Regression | 0.7821234 |
| AdaBoost | 0.7374303 |
| k-Nearest Neighbors | 0.6703911 |
| Support Vector Classifier | 0.636872 |

**Model Evaluation Metrics:**

* **Accuracy:** Overall correct predictions.
* **Precision:** Ratio of true positive predictions to total positive predictions.
* **Recall:** Ratio of true positive predictions to actual positive cases.
* **F1-Score:** Harmonic mean of precision and recall.
* **Confusion Matrix:** Visual representation of model performance.

## Key Findings

* **Decision Tree Classifier** emerged as the top-performing model, achieving the highest accuracy.
* **Random Forest Classifier** and **Logistic Regression** also demonstrated strong predictive capabilities.
* **AdaBoost**, **k-Nearest Neighbors**, and **Support Vector Classifier** exhibited lower accuracy compared to the top-performing models.

## Future Directions
