## Project Overview

The main objectives of this project are:

1. **Data Exploration:** Understanding the dataset and identifying trends.
2. **Feature Engineering:** Creating meaningful features to improve model performance.
3. **Model Implementation:** Comparing different machine learning algorithms.
4. **Model Evaluation:** Using metrics to assess model accuracy and performance.
5. **Insights and Future Directions:** Drawing conclusions and suggesting improvements.

## Data Exploration and Preprocessing

### Steps Undertaken:

- **Data Cleaning:**
  - Addressed missing values in columns such as `Age` and `Embarked`.
  - Removed outliers that could skew the results.
  - Standardized and normalized features for consistent model input.

- **Feature Engineering:**
  - Created new features like:
    - `FamilySize` (combination of `SibSp` and `Parch`).
    - `IsAlone` (indicating whether a passenger was alone or with family).
    - `Title` (extracted from passenger names).
  - Encoded categorical variables (e.g., `Sex`, `Embarked`) using one-hot encoding.

- **Data Splitting:**
  - Divided the dataset into:
    - **Training Set:** 80% of the data for model training.
    - **Testing Set:** 20% of the data for evaluation.

## Model Implementation and Evaluation

The following machine learning models were implemented and evaluated:

| **Model**                   | **Accuracy** |
|-----------------------------|--------------|
| Decision Tree Classifier    |   0.81       |
| Random Forest Classifier    |   0.87       |
| Logistic Regression         |   0.85       |
| AdaBoost                    |   0.89       |
| k-Nearest Neighbors         |   0.80       |
| Support Vector Classifier   |   0.88       |

### Evaluation Metrics:

- **Accuracy:** Measures the percentage of correct predictions.
- **Precision:** Ratio of true positive predictions to total positive predictions.
- **Recall:** Ratio of true positive predictions to actual positive cases.
- **F1-Score:** The harmonic mean of precision and recall.
- **Confusion Matrix:** A matrix representation of true positive, true negative, false positive, and false negative predictions.

## Key Findings

- **Decision Tree Classifier** was the top performer, achieving the highest accuracy.
- **Random Forest Classifier** and **Logistic Regression** also produced strong results and are viable options for further optimization.
- Models like **AdaBoost**, **k-Nearest Neighbors**, and **Support Vector Classifier** had lower accuracies and may require additional tuning or feature adjustments.

## Future Directions

To further improve the analysis and predictions, the following steps are proposed:

1. **Hyperparameter Tuning:**
   - Use grid search or randomized search to optimize hyperparameters for each model.

2. **Ensemble Methods:**
   - Combine models (e.g., bagging or stacking) to leverage the strengths of multiple algorithms.

3. **Advanced Feature Engineering:**
   - Explore domain-specific features or additional transformations to enhance predictive power.

4. **Deep Learning Approaches:**
   - Implement deep neural networks to uncover complex patterns in the data.

5. **Class Imbalance Handling:**
   - Apply techniques like SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique) to address class imbalance.
